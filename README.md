# Intro Machine Learning Project

## Project Report

### Objectives

Harmful algal blooms (HABs) threaten aquatic ecosystems by reducing water quality and biodiversity. This project, led by the team of Aiden Cox, Michael McCain, and Rose Taylor, aims to develop a binary classification model using tabular data to determine whether a given contains an algal bloom. Features such as algal biomass and chlorophyll-a concentration are extracted to train supervised learning algorithms. The resulting model provides an automated method to identify HAB presence from senosr data.

### Description

This [dataset](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/c3792mm5f6/1) contains features for detecting Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs), combining important features like the Bloom Index, chlorophyll levels, and sea surface temperature. The parameters cover a range of other factors like Nitrogen, Phosphorus, pH, etc.
