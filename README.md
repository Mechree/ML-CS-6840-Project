# Intro Machine Learning Project

## Project Report

### Objectives

Harmful algal blooms (HABs) threaten aquatic ecosystems by reducing water quality and biodiversity. This project, led by the team of Aiden Cox, Michael McCain, and Rose Taylor, aims to develop a binary classification model using tabular data to determine whether a given datapoint contains an algal bloom. Features such as algal biomass and chlorophyll-a concentration are extracted to train supervised learning algorithms. The resulting model provides an automated method to identify HAB presence from sensor data.

### Description

This [dataset](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/c3792mm5f6/1) contains features for detecting Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs), combining important features like the Bloom Index, chlorophyll levels, and sea surface temperature. The parameters cover a range of other factors like Nitrogen, Phosphorus, pH, etc.

~~What is the data~~, preprocessing performed, and unique characteristics? Why is this dataset interesting to you.

### Model Choice

What model? Why? List architecture, params, and layers.

### Training Process

Hyperparameter settings, ~~choice of training frameworks such as pytorch~~, and the test process
